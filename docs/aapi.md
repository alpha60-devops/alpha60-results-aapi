### Global Media by Week

{% include swu-media-objects-usa-global-weeks-1-5-10-20-table.html %}
<div style="height: 50px;"></div>

What is the audience for these media objects on the global internet?
How does this compare to media comparison methodologies that are restricted to five weeks of data from only the USA?

The table above shows that for the first five weeks of the media object andor-210-211-212, the downloads from the USA are roughly 1 million, the rest of the world roughtly 13 million, showing that only 9% of all peers are "from" the USA. This shows the danger of relying on a USA-centric data slice to see the global audience.

Furthermore, if one takes a longer duration, say twenty weeks, the USA slice deteriorates further: downloads from the USA are 3.8M, the rest of the world is 47.6M, only 8% ofa all peers are "from" the USA. When comparing 5 week to 20 week results, 1.2M USA to 47.6M or slightly over 2% of all peers measured.

The top six countries for andor-210-211-212 are:
